Technical Assignment:

Youâ€™re part of a new and exciting project. The project will allow customers to track a package. Once it is delivered to your homes mailbox, you will be able to lock and unlock your mailbox (EP1) with a mobile app - Assume your team also produced the hardware for the mailbox (EP1) giving you full control. You will need to create the mobile app; your cloud infrastructure will be Azure. Your application will use the mobile phones GPS for location and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to control access to the mailbox (EP1).

1. Provide a structural UML class diagram of the mobile app (I.e. Classes, Interfaces, Components etc..)
2. Implement the following functions as outlined by your UML diagram. Make any assumptions necessary - but please provide your assumptions, imports are not required. Please be specific to BLE and the OS of your choice (iOS or Android only).
   1. Connect to a discovered Mailbox (EP1)
   2. Authenticate user
   3. Send unlock command

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
* Add MAPS_API_KEY to local.default.properties file

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/heymonheymon3000/technical-assessment.git
   ```
2. Build and install ble-mailbox-central (client) on a device
3. Build and install ble-mailbox-perpherial (server) on a separate device

### Assumptions
* When scanning, filter results to my mailbox only.
* For the ble-mailbox-central use any device Android 10 or lower, it seems like it does pick up devices
* Based on the instructions it looks like I need to show the location of the user not track the location of EP1

## Demo
SM-G960U - ble-mailbox-central acts as a client and connects to ble-mailbox-peripheral via Bluetooth low energy (BLE).  After the connection is made, ble-mailbox-central must authenicate in order to lock/unlock ble-mailbox-peripheral mailbox (EP1).


SM-G973U1 -  ble-mailbox-peripheral - This is the mailbox (EP1) that we will lock/unlock by using ble-mailbox-central once its authenicated.
